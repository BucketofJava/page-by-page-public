## About ##
At PageByPage, we believe research should be accessible to all people. Access to knowledge is a universal right and complex ideas shouldnâ€™t be locked behind jargon or paywalls. Our goal is to build an online space where anyone can learn, discover, and engage with cutting-edge research. 

We transform academic papers into digestible summaries that provide intuitive and simple explanations for complex topics with little loss of detail. Our tools simplify technical terms and allow users to quickly retrieve and explore trending research topics, breaking down barriers of entry to the world of academia. In just a few minutes, you can access and understand publications from the top researchers in the world, with minimal effort and prerequisite knowledge.
